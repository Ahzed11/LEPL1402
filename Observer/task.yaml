name: "[TESTABLE] Observer design pattern"
context: |-
    In this task, you have to implement the Observer design pattern for the case of a meteo station:

    .. code-block:: java

        public class MeteoStation extends Observable {

            // YOUR CODE HERE

        }


        public class Client extends Observer {

            // YOUR CODE HERE

        }

    Note that Observable_ and Observer_ are two abstract classes containing abstract methods.
    Therefore, check and read them carefully in order to implement things correctly. We also
    provide you a Pair_ implementation, representing some kind of tuple containing a String and an int
    (**TODO** : check later with Guillaume and professors if we give them "Pair" or if we let them implement it as an exercise):

    .. _Observable: /course/LEPL1402/Observer/Observable.java
    .. _Observer: /course/LEPL1402/Observer/Observer.java
    .. _Pair: /course/LEPL1402/Observer/Pair.java
