    In this task, you should provide a TestSuite for the method binarySearch :
    
    .. code-block:: java

        /*
         * This method returns the index of the "arr" table between the 
         * "low" and "high" indexes. where is the element "elem" OR -1 
         * if "elem" is not there OR -2 if the parameters do not respect the preconditions.
         *
         * @pre low >= 0, high <= |arr|, low <= high, sorted(arr[low...high]) == true
         * @post returns the index in which the searched element is located, 
         * -1 if it is not present.
