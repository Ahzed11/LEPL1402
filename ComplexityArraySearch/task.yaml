    In this task, you have to implement a method ``search`` that looks for an element in an ascending sorted array. Your method must return the **index** of the element in the array or **-1** if you can't find the element in the array.

    We'll test the complexity of your code so try to find the best possible algorithm.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Search {

            /**
             * @param tab is an ordered array of int.
             * @return index of elem or -1
             */
            public static int search(int[] tab, int elem){
                //TODO YOUR CODE HERE
            }
        }
