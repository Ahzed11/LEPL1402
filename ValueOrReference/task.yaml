        error_message: Primitive types are passed by value in Java which means that
            changing the value of an primitive int argument inside a method, only
            updates the value in the function and not outside of it. Thus when the
            value is set to 1 in the method ``foo`` it only changes it inside the
            method and in this case not in the ``main`` method.

        success_message: Good job! Primitive types are passed by value in Java which
