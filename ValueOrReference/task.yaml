        success_message: Good job! Primitive types are passed by value in Java which
            means that changing the value of an primitive int argument inside a method,
            only updates the value in the function and not outside of it. Thus when
            the value is set to 1 in the method ``foo`` it only changes it inside
            the method and in this case not in the ``main`` method.
