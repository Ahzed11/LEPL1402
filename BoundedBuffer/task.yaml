    A bounded buffer is a way for multiple producers and consumers to synchronised. Indeed multiple producers are going to fill the buffer while consumers  are going to clear out this buffer.

    You have to implement the class BoundedBuffer_. In a bounded buffer, the element window grows to the right, shrinks to the left and slides t the right on the buffer. Here is a little example about the fonctioning of a bounded buffer :

    .. image:: /course/LEPL1402/BoundedBuffer/BoundedBuffer.png
       :scale: 100%
       :align: center
       :height: 461px
       :width: 801px

    Before submitting don't hesitate to create a producer and a consumer and to test your code.
