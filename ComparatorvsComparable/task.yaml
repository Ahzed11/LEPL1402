    In this exercise, you have to answer questions about Comparator_ and Comparable_.

    We are going to work on the Plant_, Tree_, Flower_ and Sorter_ classes. Read and understand the code in this classes before doing this is exercise!

    All the information on how the different method should work are given in comments in each class.
