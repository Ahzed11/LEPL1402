    In this task, we will ask you to implement a basic calculator (+,-,*,/) using
    the visitor design pattern. Every expression you will compute will be represented as a tree. A tree contains at least one node
    and every node of the tree is either :

    - a parent node containing two sub nodes (an operand)

    - a leaf (a value)

    Here is an example of how your code is supposed to run:

    .. code-block:: java

        Node root = new Add(                                            //((6-2)/(1+1))+(5*2)
                            new Div(                                   //(6-2)/(1+1)
                                new Sub(new Leaf(6),new Leaf(2))         //6-2
                                new Add(new Leaf(1), new Leaf(1))),      //1+1
                            new Mult(new Leaf(5), new Leaf(2)));         //5*2
        Visitor calculator = new Evaluation();

        calculator.visit((Add)root); // 12


    **We provide you a set of class you have to complete** here_

    There are a lot of classes but please don't panick, this exercise shouldn't require more than 50ish lines of code from you.

    A special case needs you to throw an ``IllegalArgumentException``.

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains few tests to help you.
