name: "[TESTABLE] Factory design pattern - Level generator"
context: |-
    In this task, we will ask you to implement a labyrinth mini-game level builder using 
    The factory design pattern. Each level consists in a set of Wall_, Key_, Floor_, Door_, all
    of them implementing the LevelComponent_ interface.
    Your objective is thus to implement the two following classes:

    .. code-block:: java

        public class ElementFactory extends Factory {

            // YOUR CODE HERE

            public static ElementFactory getInstance() {
                // YOUR SINGLETON HERE
            }

        }


        public class Level extends AbstractLevel {
            
            public Level(String input){
                // YOUR CODE HERE
            }

            // YOUR CODE HERE
        }
    
    .. _Wall: /course/LEPL1402/Factory/Wall.java
    .. _Key: /course/LEPL1402/Factory/Key.java
    .. _Floor: /course/LEPL1402/Factory/Floor.java
    .. _Door: /course/LEPL1402/Factory/Door.java
    .. _LevelComponent: /course/LEPL1402/Factory/LevelComponent.java

    Note that these two classes extends the abstract classes Factory_ and AbstractLevel_. Pay attention, we add a small constraint to this exercise: your ElementFactory
    **must** be a singleton (i.e, it should not be possible to instantiate your factory
    with java's ``new`` keyword). For your ``Level`` class, what we want you to do is, given a String, create a ``Level`` object whose ``components``
    is a 2D array where each cell represent a ``LevelComponent``. Note that all sub-arrays in ``components`` will have the same size as we will only ask you to create "square" labyrinths.
