    In this task, we will ask you to implement two different versions of the Fibonacci sequence number: a recursive one and an iterative one.
    The objective of this exercise is to make you aware of what a call stack is and what problem could occur. We strongly suggest you to
    test your code with various input : what will happen if you test your recursive implementation with a very large index. Why ? Will the same
    thing happen with your iterative implementation ? Why ?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Fibonacci {

            /*
             * Returns the index-th element of the fibonnaci sequence, computed recursively
             */
            public static int fiboRecursive(int index){
                // YOUR CODE HERE
            }

            /*
             * Returns the index-th element of the fibonnaci sequence, computed iteratively
             */
            public static int fiboIterative(int index){
                // YOUR CODE HERE
            }

        }


    Reminder : Fibonacci's sequence is computed as follows

    .. math::

         f(n) =\begin{cases}0 & n=0 \\1 & n = 1\\ f(n-1) + f(n-2) & n > 1\end{cases}
