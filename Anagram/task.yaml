    In this task you need to implement the Anagram class. A word `w1` is an anagram of a word `w2` if it consists of all the letters of `w2`, possibly in another order.
    For example, the word "evil" is an anagram of the word "vile".
    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_, to help you get started.
