    In this exercise we ask you to implement the top-down_ merge sort  algorithm on an array of integer. You have to use **2 methods**:

        - Sort, this method has to divide the array and apply merge.
        - Merge, this method has to merge the array given the 2 index, it receives from sort 3 index, lower bound, middle and high. It also receives a copy of the first array.

    The tests are build to make you able to test the two methods separly but we **recommand** you to test them by yourself.

    Here is the class MergeSort_:

    .. code-block:: java

        public class MergeSort {

            /**
             * Merge the array from lo to hi
             */
            private static void merge(int[] a, int[] aux, int lo, int mid, int hi) {
                // TODO By Student
            }
            /**
             *  Split the array and call merge
             */
            public static void sort(int[] a) {
                // TODO By Student
            }

            //TODO Optionnal additionnal method
        }
