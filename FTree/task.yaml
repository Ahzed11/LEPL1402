    In this exercise you have to complete the class FTree_, Node_ and Leaf_. Ftree_ is an abstract class that represents a binary true, it is extended by Node and Leaf. A Node_ is a FTree_ with two children (left and right) and a value. A Leaf_ is terminal, so it has a value but no children.

    In the FTree_ class you must *recursivly* implement:
        - depth : returns the depth of the tree (we assume that the tree is balanced)
        - map : receives a function as argument and apply it to all the values contained in the tree

    To complete the Node_ class you must:
        - implement the constructor
        - extend FTree_

    To complete the Leaf_ class you must :
        - implement the constructor
        - extend FTree_
